# React-Rendering-Portfolio

## Description

In this project I wanted to create React application that will render different pages in different routes. I added different rendering points like:

- NavBar and Footer that will folow user all the time with navigation buttons
- About me page that render info about me and my picture
- Portfolio page that render different groups of projects that I done in my journey
- Resume page that render pdf file of my resume in big screen and image of resume on small screens
- Contact me page that render contcat me form and check input conditions
- Error page if user hit wrong route
